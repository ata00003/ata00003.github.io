       <h2>About Me</h2>       
        <p>Hello! I am Elif. I am from Turkey and I have been living in Ottawa with my husband and two sons. 
     The year 2022 will be our 3<sup>rd</sup> year in Ottawa.
     I study in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> and feel excited for the journey ahead as a designer. 
     I have always had interest in physical and digital design. I would like to create <em>logos, brochures or website.</em> </p>
        <p>My interests outside of design include exploring new places, cooking and drinking tea with my friends.
     I also love reading books and generally prefer novels and parenting books. I enjoy new and challenging tasks 
     that push me to learn more and to find solutions to problems looking from different angles.
